\title{Metapopulation capacity (MPC) core function}
\usage{
MPC(pa, mdist, alpha, dispfun, ex, self, evec, symmetric, lower, savememory)
}
\arguments{
\item{pa}{A numeric vector of areas of habitat patches 1-n}

\item{mdist}{A square matrix of pairwise distances between habitat patches 1-n}

\item{alpha}{A species-specific dispersal distance (e.g. average gap-crossing distance), default=317m}

\item{dispfun}{A species-specific dispersal survival function, currently 3 options can be chosen by parameter dispfop: "negex", "linear" and "log-sech"}

\item{ex}{A stochasticity parameter: if x >1, it becomes very unlikely for populations to go extinct after a critical patch size has been reached. If x <1, there exists no critical patch size and populations can even go extinct if they are large (Hanski 1994)}

\item{self}{Logical: should self-colonization of patches be modeled (default, TRUE) or not (FALSE)}

\item{evec}{Logical: should the dominant eigenvalue associated eigenvector be returned (default, TRUE) or not (FALSE)}

\item{savememory}{Logical: should objects that are not necessary be removed from the environment to save memory?}
}
\value{
An 'MPC' object: a list containing a numeric MPC value (mpc), metapopulation density (mpcdens), the MPC-associated squared dominant eigenvector indicating patch importance (pimport) and the patch IDs in case they are indicated (pid)
}
\description{
Calculates MPC for a given set of habitat patches. The function relies on the 'sf' and 'stars'packages
